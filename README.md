# jane-austen-text-generator

This generator was built to synthesize sentences in the "writing style" of Jane Austen. 

All texts pulled from Project Gutenberg. Links to the file locations on the Project Gutenberg site can be found below.

Emma (158-0): https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/158 
Sense and Sensability (pg161): https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/161 
Pride and Prejudice (1342-0): https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1342 

This can be run with a gui or in command line. To use the gui, run writer_gui.py with no arguments. To use in command line, run austen_writer.py with argument 1 as the name of the source text file (in parenthesis above) and argument 2 being how many words you want in the sentence. In general this generator was developed around 10-15 word sentences.

The latest version of PyForms must be installed on your machine for the gui to work.
